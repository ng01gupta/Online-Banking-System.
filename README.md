# Online-Banking-System.
Online Bank Management System is very simple and entry level 
Project developed in java using JDBC technology. I have implemented most of the feature of online banking in it. User can login, do withdrawal, Request a Deposit amount, Transfer amount from one account to another account, check his/her current balance, and view reports of all the transaction.
